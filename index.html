        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Allen Redshaw, and my birthday is on October the 11<sup>th</sup>. I worked as a carpenter for the last 10 years, and have recently entered that Algonquin IMD program to change careers. before commiting to the program, I did some online coding classes to see if i was sure i would like the work. the program I did was a full stack web development course, that included <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>, and javaScript.</p>
        <p>I like to go on walks with my camera and take pictures as a hobby. Generally I take pictures of birds, but sometimes I practice portraits and landscapes. When the weather agrees I have a telescope that i use to take pictures of things in space; like nebulas and galaxies.</p>
